# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is available in unique mobile and desktop versions, and is responsive to all size screens. Users can post tweets and view tweets that have already been posted. Much like its predecessor, users cannot post tweets over 140 characters in length.
